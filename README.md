# About Shape

Shape makes sourcecode filesystem directories.  
The goal is to standardize the filesystem directory structure of the sourcecode.  
This standard represents the SHAPE of the sourcecode, a shared understanding of the 
file location of various sourcecode artifacts.  Having this shared understanding
makes it easier for various contributors and stakeholders to collaborate on
the creation, editing, reviewing and other activities related to sourcecode.

The primary inputs of Shape are Seed and Topology.  Seed contains the metadata about a system (e.g. Name, Version, Features, etc...).  Topology contains configuration about various system spaces (User Interface, Network, Database, Storage, Compute, Access Management, etc...)
